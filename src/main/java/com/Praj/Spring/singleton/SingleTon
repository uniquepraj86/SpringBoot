 what is singleton design pattern?
	- only one instance of class created throughout the application
	Steps:
		a) constructors should be private
		b) provide static method which returns ref. of instance
		 lazy initialisation concept is used to write static method
		c) instance is stored as private static variable


		class Student{
			private int rno;
			private String name;
			private static Student s;
			private Student(){

			}
			public static Student getStudent(){
				if(s==null)
				return new Student();
			}
		}
		class School{

		Student s = Student.getStudent();
		}
